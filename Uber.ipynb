        "The Uber Supply Demand Gap project aimed to analyze and address the persistent mismatch between rider demand and Uber cab availability for trips from the airport to the city. Drawing from both analytical summaries and a detailed examination of ride request data, the project provides a comprehensive view of how supply-demand dynamics fluctuate throughout the day and identifies the critical periods where service gaps are most pronounced.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis began by segmenting Uber ride requests by hour, using both the provided summary and the underlying request data to map patterns of demand and supply. The findings, reveal that the most significant supply-demand gaps occur during the night and early morning hours. These time slots consistently show the highest number of unfulfilled ride requests, with the gap peaking between approximately 5 AM to 9 AM and again from 7 PM to 11 PM. The data further indicates that while daytime and afternoon periods experience relatively balanced supply and demand, the night and early morning windows remain critical problem areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "A deeper investigation into the causes of these gaps highlights two main operational challenges. First, there is a marked unavailability of cabs during the night. This is likely due to fewer drivers choosing to operate during late hours, possibly because of safety concerns, lower perceived profitability, or personal scheduling preferences. Second, the early morning and morning slots are characterized by a high rate of ride cancellations by drivers. The data suggests that drivers may cancel rides during these hours for reasons such as shift changes, fatigue, or a preference for more lucrative or convenient trips. As a result, even when riders are able to request cabs, the likelihood of their rides being canceled increases significantly during these periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "The raw ride request data further supports these conclusions. Completed trip timestamps show a sharp drop in successful rides during the night and early morning, aligning with the charted demand gap. Conversely, during the day, completed trips are more evenly distributed, indicating that supply generally meets demand outside of the problematic hours[2]. This pattern is consistent across multiple days and is not limited to isolated incidents, suggesting a systemic issue rather than random fluctuation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project’s findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions to address the supply-demand gap. For Uber, potential strategies could include incentivizing drivers to operate during night and early morning hours, implementing dynamic pricing to attract more supply when demand is high, or developing operational policies that minimize cancellations during critical periods. Additionally, improving driver support and safety measures during late hours could help increase cab availability. Ultimately, closing the supply-demand gap during these specific time slots would enhance rider satisfaction, reduce wait times, and improve the overall reliability of Uber’s airport-to-city service.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the Uber Supply Demand Gap project provides a data-driven understanding of when and why service mismatches occur, backed by both visual analytics and granular ride data. The insights gained point to actionable steps that can help Uber better align its supply with customer demand, particularly during the night and early morning hours, ensuring a smoother and more dependable experience for riders and drivers alike.\n",

The dataset contains information about timestamps, pickup locations, driver allocations, and trip statuses, which enables us to examine demand-supply relationships in multiple ways. For example, we can analyze the time it taken for trip status to change, and account for when cancellations and “no cars available” alerts occur by hour and time of day. We want to identify key choke points, including but not limited to, driver unavailability on peak periods, and whether the number of driver pickups was relatively balanced between the Airport and City observations on time and space. This would allow us to build an optimized driver deployment model, predictive demand model, and ultimately improve the customer experience. In a long-term sense, we want to provide Uber data driven solutions that minimize unmet demand, maximize driver utilization rate, and respond in real time to demand-supply mismatches."

        "The Python code performs structured data wrangling on the Uber request dataset for analysis. The code first drops irrelevant empty columns (namely, Unnamed: 6, Unnamed: 7, and Unnamed: 8) likely added during the CSV export process. The code then converts the Request timestamp and Drop timestamp to standard datetime formats to fix inconsistencies and allow for valuable analysis on the timeline of events. The code extracts the hour of the day from the cleaned Request timestamp and categorizes each request into a \"Time of Day\" category (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Late Night) based on specified hourly cubes. The code also collects the Day of Week for further trend analysis by week of the week. Each of these new data fields increases the possible analytical impact of the dataset for assessing when ride requests may reach peaks, when ride requests are difficult to handle, and how differential patterns may exist by time of day or week of the week. Lastly, the cleaned dataset is saved to a new CSV file to be used for dashboards or to make further models."
